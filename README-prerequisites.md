# Prerequisites

**Note:** You don't have to meet any of these prerequisites to have fun... The directory `sample-output` contains all the output you would have generated if you ran the code yourself, including the html dashboard and clustering results in .pdf files.  :)

But if you want to get into the code, read on:

<p>&nbsp;</p>

- IBM Cloud (formerly IBM Bluemix)

  1. If you want to run any sample code, sign up for [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud).
  
  2. If you want to perform classification (that's files 01 - 04, and 10), provision an instance of the [Watson Natural Language Classifier](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-classifier) service (there is a free plan.)
  
  3. If you want to perform general or custom natural language understanding (that's files 05 - 10), provision an instance of the [Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding) service.
  
  4. If you want to create a custom language model (that's files 07 - 09), sign up for [Watson Knowledge Studio](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/supervised-machine-learning) (there's a 30-day free trial.)

- On your computer

  1. If you want to run any Node.js sample code, perform these steps:
  
      1. [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
    
      2. After downloading all the files from this repo, install the needed Node.js libraries by issuing the following command from the `sample-code` directory:<br/><p>`npm install`</p><p>(This command will use the file `package.json` to know which libraries are needed.)</p>
    
  2. If you want to perform clustering locally (that's an R script generated by file 13), [install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download).<br/><p>If you don't want to install RStudio locally, some alternative ways to run the clustering script are listed [here](https://github.com/spackows/CASCON-2017_Analyzing_chat/blob/master/README.md).</p>
