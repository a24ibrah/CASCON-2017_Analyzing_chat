# Prerequisites

**Note:** You don't have to meet any of these prerequisites to have fun... The directory `sample-output` contains all the output you would have generated if you ran the code yourself, including the html dashboard and clustering results.  :)

But if you want to get into the code, read on...

- On your computer:

  1. If you want to run any Node.js sample code, perform these steps:
  
      1. [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
    
      2. After downloading all the files from this repo, install the needed Node.js libraries by issuing the following command from the `sample-code` directory:<br/><p>`npm install`</p><p>(This command will use the file `package.json` to know which libraries are needed.)</p>
    
  2. If you want to perform clustering (run R scripts generated by file 13) locally, [install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download).

- IBM Cloud (formerly IBM Bluemix):

  1. If you want to run sample code in files 01-10 or 14, sign up for [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud).
  
  2. If you want to perform classification (that's files 01-04, and 10), provision an instance of the [Watson Natural Language Classifier](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-classifier) service.
  
  3. If you want to perform general or custom natural language understanding (that's files 05 - 10), provision an instance of the [Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding) service.
  
  4. If you want to create a custom language model (that's files 07-09), sign up for [Watson Knowledge Studio](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/supervised-machine-learning).
  
  5. If you want to perform clustering (run R scripts generated by file 13) on a Db2 Warehouse on Cloud server, provision an instance of [Db2 Warehouse on Cloud](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/db2-warehouse-on-cloud) service.

  **Note:** These services have free trials or entry-level plans that don't cost anything when you stay below a certain use threshold.
